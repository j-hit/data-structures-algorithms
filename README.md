# data-structures-algorithms

A repository to keep a hold of some of my solutions as I work my way through some questions

Mainly going through the data structure and algorithm questions found on the [Google Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/) and in the [Cracking the Coding Interview Book](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
